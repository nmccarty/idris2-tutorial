* Conversion tasks and initial editing
** DONE Get CI up and running
** DONE Fix that whole extra line breaks bug
** DONE Rewrite README
*** DONE Link to SUMMARY.md
*** DONE Document building mdbook
*** DONE Move some of the existing prose to a preface chapter
** DONE Build docker container locally instead of using one from my personal forgejo
** DONE Add links from github to mdbook and from mdbook to github
This one's best done after migrating to the community project so we can have the correct url
** DONE Organize ipkg modules in chapter order
** DONE Break Chapters into sub-chapters as appropriate
** DONE Configure mdformat
** DONE Audit links
** DONE Figure out exercise solutions situation
Will probably want to either convert the solutions files to markdown with katla or manually, and add them in a an appendex. Will need to go back and insert links/references.
** DONE Consistent on summary vs conclusion
** STRT Clean Up Prose
Need to:
+ Remove use of first person singular, to reflect the collective ownership
+ Update prose to reflect the new sub-chapter structure
+ Update links and clean up broken ones
+ Other minor editing changes to make the text flow better
** TODO Cleanup Imports and Exports
** TODO Clean up fixity declarations
** TODO Cleanup references to outdated sources
Like the wiki library page
** TODO Clean up exercise titling
Make sure section names match up with headers in solutions
** TODO Inject highlighted repl output
*** TODO Actual test injection
Thread local IDEMode?
*** TODO Golden Tests
Should golden test the repl outputs to detect breakage

These should also be compared in a whitespace insensitive way, im thinking, like:
#+begin_src markdown
```repl-session
> length ["lines that start with > are repl commands"]
1
> length ["subsequent lines before the next", "are the golden output"]
2
```
#+end_src

This keeps it readable as a raw markdown document, but provides easy processing for extraction and injection of the /actual/ repl output complete with highlighting.
*** TODO Special Handling for exec
** TODO Selenized custom themes
Because I love myself
** TODO Admonish
Get an admonishment extension up and running and edit to use it as appropiate
** IDEA Standard library types
When a subchapter reimplements a standard library type, we should maybe call this out and use the standard library type in future subchapters to decrease cross dependencies
** IDEA Rename Modules To Chapter/Subchapter number?
Could also potentially insert automatic linking?
* New sections
** TODO Property based testing
** TODO Place modules and visibility primer in the introduction
This needs to come early in the book so new programmers can make sense of the use of imports to reference statements from the previous chapter.
* Mdbook features
** TODO linkcheck
** TODO open-on-gh
